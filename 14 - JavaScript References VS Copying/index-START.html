    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); //100 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); //200 100 

    let name = 'Alice'
    let name2 = name;

    console.log(name, name2); //Alice, Alice
    name = 'Bob'
    console.log(name, name2); //Bob, Alice

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    let team = players;
    team[3] = 'Alice';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    console.log(team); //3 - Alice
    console.log(players); //3 - Alice (unlike above)

    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const newTeam = players.slice();
    newTeam[3] = 'Bob';
    // one way
    console.log(newTeam); //3 - Bob
    console.log(players); //3 - Alice

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let newArray = [].concat(players);
    let newWay = [...players]; // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let fromWay = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    newArray[3] = 'Charlie';
    newWay[3] = 'Dave';
    fromWay[3] = 'Eve';
    console.log(newArray); // Charlie
    console.log(newWay); // Dave
    console.log(fromWay); // Eve
    console.log(players); // Alice

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(person.age); //99
    console.log(captain.age); //99

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let newPerson = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 100});
    console.log(person.age); //99
    console.log(newPerson.age); //100

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const extra = {...person}; //well that runs so it exists now
    extra.age = 1;
    console.log(extra.age); //1
    console.log(person.age); //99

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
